Here is my guide to the basic garb components. Each link will take you to the piece in question, and discuss fabric choices, notions and patterns that I've found useful in making garb. I'veposted my mistakes and shortcuts and advice in the cases that I've actually tried.
I've kept mostly to the major commercial pattern companies (Simplicity, McCalls, etc.) because one, that what I use mostly, and two, they're easier to find than specialty patterns, and usually don't cost as much. Oftentimes, your local fabric store will have sales, too. I have picked up most of my patterns for $0.99 to $1.99 at these sales.

If you're willing to experiement a little, they work just as well, if not better, than custom patterns.

If you have any ideas, input, experiences, please [EMAIL](mailto:chimera@umich.edu)! I'm always looking for new ideas and better ways of doing this!
