# Women's Vests

If you've got it, flaunt it. And even if you don't have it, a well made vest will at least give the illusion...

**Material**

You can use any manner of fabric for a good vest, but I've found that heavier weight fabrics work best: brocades, velvets, blends, etc. And check into upholstery fabrics! They are a nice weight, and many have beautiful textures and patterns.

I recommend cotton or cotton blends for lining. Comfortable, breathes, wears well... A good thing if you're doing faires in August.

**Notions**

I tend to use very basic notions. Since I don't do this for authenticities sake, I use zippers, hook and eyes, and grommets for fastenings.

Zippers and hook and eyes are fairly self-explanatory. Follow the directions on your pattern.

As for grommets, which I use quite often with bodices and vests, you want to use the larger, sturdier kind. The small ones, which you can attach with the special pliers, are a pain in the arse when working with the heavy fabrics used in garb making. When using grommets, you want to reinforce the section of fabric you will be placing them in. I recommend using a heavier-weight interfacing. Also, when inserting the grommets, don't attempt to cut a circle to place the grommet stem in. Make a small X at the proper place with a sharp Xacto knife or equivalent. I tried this method on my last outfit, and it worked wonderfully.

And don't forget to use some boning in the front to give extra support. Dritz's Featherweight boning works very well.
