# Chemises

One of the most basic, and simplest, pieces to make. Very versatile.

**Material**

I find that for comfort, ease of care, and cost, the chemise, or underdress, is best made out of cotton, broadcloth, or muslin. All three beathe well, are lightweight, and relatively inexpensive. You can use satin, as is often pictured in some commercial patterns, but it's much warmer, is very difficult to work with, and can't just be tossed in the washing machine.

**Notions**

There isn't much in the way of notions for the chemise. Elastic or ribbon for the sleeves and neckline is about it.
