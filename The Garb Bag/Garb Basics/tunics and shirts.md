A tunic or shirt can be one of the easiest pieces of garb to make, and is one of the most versatile to use in completing your garb. They can be unisex, or styled for men or women.

**Material**

In most cases, I recommend cotton, maybe a cotton/poly blend, or linen for most tunics and shirts. They're cheap. lightweight, wash well, and easy to work with. Broadcloth is one of my favorites: it's sturdy, wears well, and is often very inexpensive (under $3 a yard).

If you want to go a bit fancier, such as for a man's dress tunic, then a good heavy brocade would be an option, or even drapery and some upholstery remnants are very good choices.

Simplicity

* [8286](8286.jpg) (was 9229), View B (man standing on right)- A good simple tunic that can be done with ot without collar. With a dressy fabric, would make good feast garb.
