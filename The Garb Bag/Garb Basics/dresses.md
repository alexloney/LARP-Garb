Simplicity

* [8715](8715.jpg) - Another new one. Very similar to a McCall's pattern, I believe (I'll get the number later). Nice bodice and overskirt.
* [8725](8725.jpg) - Just saw this one, and haven't tried it yet. Looks like a simple kirtle and side-open dress.
* [8735](8735.jpg) - Another new one. Looks heavily inspired by the movie "Ever After". Period elements, but looks quite nice. Top on my list to try this summer Details forthcoming!

McCall's

* 8826 - A simple kirtle pattern. I've made three with this pattern, and have been very pleased withthe results. I've also used it as the base for two or three other designs. The trickiest part is the facing at the neckline, but otherwise it is all straight seams. If you are under 5'5", I recommend using the shortest version (unless you want the train effect). Also has a side-open dress, which I have not yet tried.
