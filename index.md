# Fantasy Costuming and Associated Miscellany

Welcome to the "Garb Bag". This site, devoted to fantasy costuming and associated miscellany, is designed to be both a "how-to" resource, where I have posted my experiences with costuming over the last few years, and a compilation of links to my favorite sites on the web that deal with costuming and its various aspects.

So explore at your leisure. Clicking on the Garb Bag logo
